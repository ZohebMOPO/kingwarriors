## Inspiration
In August 2020,  I saw an [article](https://news.stanford.edu/2020/08/06/stanford-students-create-virtual-campus-recapture-university-experience/). It was an eye-opener. My `perspective` changed of watching how the web app works. This was my inspiration.
## What it does
You can move around the map and experience the waterloo campus in a much better way :).
## How I built it
I built it using React for the frontend and used Mapbox API for showing the map and scraped the data from Waterloo [Website](https://uwaterloo.ca/information-systems-technology/statistics/wifi-charts/building-select-index)
## Challenges I ran into
First of all my stack was using Golang and React for the frontend. But due to some database issues. (11hrs left to the submission) I dropped down the idea of using it and move forward with a little bit different idea and make something that is actually visual. I also had a chat feature(using Firebase API). I couldn't do it because I had the free tier(which doesn't let you use their `authentication` service). So I had to drop down some awesome features due to some financial issues which would have made the web app more authentic.
## Accomplishments that I am proud of
I am proud that it is fetching the Mapbox API and I am glad that this hackathon taught me how to make decisions in various situations. I increased my maturity tbh.
## What I learned
I learned Golang, used it as a back-end language. Even tho, in the end, I shifted to something else it was worth using.
## What's next for King Warrior
If I get some kind of `credit card or funding` then I am really looking forward to adding authentication and making a user Dashboard and bringing all waterloo students together with area-wise chats and 
 personal DMs and I hope that the journey begins from `EngHack`.
